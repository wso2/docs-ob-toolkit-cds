WSO2 Open Banking CDS Toolkit is a purpose-built solution for regulatory compliance that supports Australia Consumer
Data Right and Consumer Data Standard. Instead of building an open banking solution from scratch, you can use WSO2 Open 
Banking CDS Toolkit to meet all open banking requirements with additional benefits beyond compliance. This toolkit runs 
on top of the following WSO2 products:

- WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator 3.0
- WSO2 Identity Server 5.11.0
- WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0
- WSO2 Streaming Integrator 4.0.0

!!! note
    The WSO2 Open Banking CDS Toolkit is built by customizing the WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator and helps you 
    comply with the Open Banking Standard. For more information on the accelerator, see 
    the [WSO2 Open Banking Accelerator Documentation](https://ob.docs.wso2.com/).

The toolkit mainly addresses the open banking requirements such as API consumer application onboarding, consent 
management, and access authorization among numerous other features to set up an open banking solution. 

!!! tip
    In a standalone setup, these products are deployed in a single server. However, in a typical production environment, 
    it is recommended to deploy the components in separate servers (distributed) for better performance.
